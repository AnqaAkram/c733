# Timezone Converter Widget
## User Story
It’s well over midnight when you suddenly receive an email from ACM regarding an exciting upcoming webinar. You are already hooked and immediately seek the timings only to find out it’s on July 27 at 11:00 AM ET/15:00 UTC. **ET? UTC?** Your brain that can grapple your own local time zone and maybe just maybe 1-2 more of nearby countries and/or special loved one’s time zone, immediately blanks out!

You notice, the left-hand side is pre-filled with your local time zone, present date  & time while the right-hand side has ‘america-new_york’ as the target time zone.

Lo and behold, the time and date of your local time zone automatically adjusts to the right time within 3-4 clicks.
